# CISassign4
 This program Asks the user for more students to add to an initialized ArrayList. Once the
parameters are entered by the user the student object is created and stored inside the list. Once the 
user is done inputting students, the arraylist is converted into an array of size studentList.size().
Then i utilized code my code from assignment 3 to search the array for the inputted ID.
